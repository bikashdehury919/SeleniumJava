# Framework Architecture
The framework is modularized into various packages for better organization:

enums: Centralized configuration keys using enums.
fileManager: Handles configuration file management.
frameworkFactory: WebDriver initialization and teardown.
functionLibrary: Utility functions (e.g., screenshots, waits).
objectLibrary: Page object classes representing application pages.
testCases: Test classes following test methods.
